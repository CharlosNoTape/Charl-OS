# Charl-OS
I'm building an operating system from scratch because I want to learn new things. I'm starting to think I'm a masochist...

## Requirements
The operating system requires x86_64 assembler (nasm) and a cpu emulator (qemu) in order to develop and run. These can be installed on Mac OSX or Linux following the instructions below:

Mac OSX (Through Homebrew):
```
brew install nasm qemu
```

Linux (using apt):
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install nasm qemu
```
> Install instructions should be similar for non debian based distros
